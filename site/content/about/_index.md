title: A new way to discover
subtitle: ' '
intro: >-
  DNA sequencing costs are dropping exponentially, and DNA synthesis costs are
  not far behind. These technologies are enabling genome sequencing and
  engineering at an unprecedented scale. Many of the world's most important
  drugs are derived from nature, found piecemeal without knowledge of the source
  DNA sequence. Hexagon Bio's mission is to turn the world's DNA into medicines.

  heading: Our Unique Process
  text: >-
    Our core technologies were developed by our founders at Stanford
    University. 

    Hexagon Bio's proprietary methods allow us to develop drugs against novel
    targets, even targets previously considered undruggable. Our focus is on
    oncology and antifungal drugs.

      The TICker algorithm can identify human targets of cryptic natural
      products, prioritizing among thousands of candidates.

      The HEx platform for rapid production of Targeted Bioengineered Small
      Molecules (TBSMs) creates new chemical entities, not repurposed drugs.
