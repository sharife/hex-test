title: A new way to discover
subtitle: ' DNA sequencing costs are dropping exponentially, and DNA synthesis costs are not far behind.'
intro: >-
  These technologies are enabling genome sequencing and engineering at an
  unprecedented scale. Many of the world's most important drugs are derived from
  nature, found by accident without knowledge of the source DNA sequence. We start from genomic data, then use our advanced software to identify, prioritize, and generate variants of the most promising molecules for testing.

  heading: Our Unique Process
  text: >-
    Our core technologies were developed by our founders at Stanford
    University. Hexagon Bio's proprietary methods allow us to develop drugs against novel
    targets, even targets previously considered undruggable. Our focus is on
    oncology and antifungal drugs.

      The TICker algorithm can identify human targets of cryptic natural
      products, prioritizing among thousands of candidates.
