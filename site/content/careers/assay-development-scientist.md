description: >-
  As an Assay Development Scientist on the Bioassays team at Hexagon Bio, you
  will design and conduct experiments to test the bioactivity of molecules
  produced by the HEx platform. You  will be responsible for performing,
  optimizing, and interpreting biochemical activity assay kits, developing new
  enzymatic activity assays and performing human cell viability studies. 
   
  Youâ€™ll develop relationships with contract research organizations to run
  binding studies of molecules to target proteins (e.g. microscale
  thermophoresis, surface plasmon resonance, and/or thermal shift assays). 
   
  This role will require significant time in the laboratory to see the studies
  from development through execution. Your data analysis and scientific input
  will be critical to your success in this role.
