  For decades, fungi have been a source of U.S. Food and Drug
  Administrationâ€“approved natural products such as penicillin, cyclosporine, and
  the statins. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing suggest that millions of
  fungal species exist on Earth, with each genome encoding pathways capable of
  generating as many as dozens of natural products. However, the majority of
  encoded molecules are difficult or impossible to access because the organisms
  are uncultivable or the genes are transcriptionally silent. To overcome this
  bottleneck in natural product discovery, we developed the HEx (Heterologous
  EXpression) synthetic biology platform for rapid, scalable expression of
  fungal biosynthetic genes and their encoded metabolites in Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. We applied this platform to 41 fungal biosynthetic gene clusters
  from diverse fungal species from around the world, 22 of which produced
  detectable compounds. These included novel compounds with unexpected
  biosynthetic origins, particularly from poorly studied species. This result
  establishes the HEx platform for rapid discovery of natural products from any
  fungal species, even those that are uncultivable, and opens the door to
  discovery of the next generation of natural products.
